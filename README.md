# Era-Of-Drifting
An Unreal 5 engine based 3D Platformer game that set up challenge in a fraction-less world
"The Era of Drifting" is a high-octane action platformer game that offers a unique twist to the genre. Set in an expansive world where friction is a mere concept, players are challenged to master the art of momentum and acceleration. To survive in the treacherous cold, you are forced to pursue the Bonfires.

The core mechanic of The Era of Drifting revolves around the kinetic dance of pushing ice blocks and performing wall-bounce-and-jump to achieve the necessary speed to traverse otherwise impassable areas. The ice blocks might lie dormant, waiting for the player's touch to awaken their potential. It is a game that demands precision and agility, as players must learn to seamlessly push the ice, bounce off walls, and glide across chasms with a thrilling sense of speed.

The Era of Drifting is an adrenaline-fueled journey that simulates real-world physics in a frictionless environment. In the beginning, players may find the controls challenging, struggling to synchronize their movements with the game's physics. Mastery is not immediate; it is earned through perseverance. With each attempt, players will improve their timing and reflexes, eventually achieving a fluid dance of motion that feels exhilaratingly fast and satisfying.The game's design encourages players to become intimately familiar with the mechanics of a world without friction, providing an intense and rewarding experience for those willing to take on the challenge.

Designed exclusively for the PC platform, The Era of Drifting promises to deliver quick, adrenaline-pumping gameplay that will captivate players with its rapid pace and unique physics-based challenges. The game's development is expected to be an agile process, 
with a projected completion timeline of 5 weeks, or approximately 42 man-hours, assuming a dedicated team of 3 part-time designers and developers. "Get ready to dive headfirst into the realm of The Era of Drifting, where you'll conquer challenges and outlast the freeze before it's too late."

# Game Design

## High Concepts
“The Era of Drifting” designed by Yueyang, Mengxuan and Licheng, is a single player platformer that encourages the flow experience for players. The player should use the momentum to control their characters to step on the drifting friction block to avoid areas of abyss, where they fall to death. Friction blocks might be originally still and players need to hit them to get them transferred. The players can also jump from a fast moving block to produce “Ultimate Jump” to jump farther. The players’ goal is to reach the Bonfire by passing those abyss on the map.
